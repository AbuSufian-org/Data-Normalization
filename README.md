# Data-Normalization / Database
Excited to share my recent work on understanding and applying database normalization techniques! ðŸŒŸ

In my latest assignment, I took a deep dive into SQL normalization (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and optimize data structures. Starting with a table filled with repeating groups and partial dependencies, I transformed it into an efficient, well-structured set of tables.

Through this process, I learned how removing anomalies improves database performance, data consistency, and overall scalability. From breaking down complex relationships to ensuring atomicity and functional dependencies, this exercise has been a game-changer for me in understanding database management and SQL. ðŸ’¡

Feeling confident in my ability to build robust, normalized databases and ready to tackle more challenging SQL projects! ðŸš€
